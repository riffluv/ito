Before finishing a task: run `npm run typecheck` for TS errors and appropriate Jest/Playwright specs for affected flows (e.g., `tests/roomMachine.spec.ts`). Validate production behavior via `npm run build && npm run start` when UI state or Pixi interactions change. Document changes or incidents in `docs/OPERATIONS.md` or relevant knowledge bases, and ensure trace logging is kept accurate.
