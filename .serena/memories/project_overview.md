Online cooperative deduction game "Jomonsho III" (ito-like) built with Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Chakra UI, Pixi.js 8, GSAP 3, Firebase (Firestore/RTDB/Auth/Functions) and Stripe. Current branch always uses the XState-based FSM (`lib/state/roomMachine.ts`), Pixi background handled by `ThreeBackground`, and RTDB presence is the single source of truth. Key docs live in `docs/` (GAME_LOGIC_OVERVIEW, OPERATIONS, performance reports, etc.).
