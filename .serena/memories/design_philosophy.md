Player experience prioritizes smooth Pixi/GSAP animations with server-authoritative state. HUD and Pixi background stay separated for clarity, and UI should communicate status promptly (e.g., notify while awaiting server confirmation). Respect RTDB presence timings and avoid blocking flows when data is still loading; prefer optimistic UI only when server result is definitive.
